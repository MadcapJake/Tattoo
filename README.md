> *Tattoo A Terminal TOO*

Tattoo is a terminal emulator program written in Python GTK3 and using VTE for terminal emulation.  Tattoo was created to provide an aesthetically pleasing terminal emulator for Gnome Shell.

### Goals

* To provide a terminal app that fits the new Gnome look
* To provide much of the functionality of Gnome Terminal
* To add some additional niceties

### Roadmap

* Wire up menu dropdown
* Add application menu
* Dropdown menus for each tab
* Searchbar ala Nautilus that searches zsh/fish/bash command history or builds and executes `find` commands in the current tab.
* Add configuration/settings for most/all of Gnome Terminal preferences
* Support DnD of tabs between Tattoo windows
* Allow importing popular theme/colorscheme formats
* Colored emoji in the terminal!
* Zsh/Fish builtin prompt-builder and configuration

## Contribute

I have no experience packaging a Python application up or building install scripts so any help with that would be greatly appreciated!

Don't forget to submit your issues/suggestions!
